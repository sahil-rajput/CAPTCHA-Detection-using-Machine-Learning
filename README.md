# CAPTCHA-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
I have designed a model using machine learning which can detect and break CAPTCHA.
<br>
This model is trained at 10,000 captcha image data set which is generated manually through Wordpress plugin( Found here : https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/).<br>
After training this model, it is able to detect the captcha with accuracy of 99.98%.

# Motivation
Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python by Adrian Rosebrock. (Found here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adrianrosebrock/deep-learning-for-computer-vision-with-python-eboo) where the author showed how he bypassed the CAPTCHA on the New York website using machine learning.
