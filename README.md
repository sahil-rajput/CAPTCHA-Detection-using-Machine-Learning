# CAPTCHA-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
I have designed a model using machine learning which can detect CAPTCHA.
<br>
This model is trained at 10,000 captcha image data set which is generated manually through Wordpress plugin( Found here : https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/).<br>
After training this model is able to detect the captcha with accuracy of 99.98%.
